# The glslang in the repo root is for Linux and will not run on macOS, so we remove it and use the global one installed by HomeBrew

# In the build process, meson install is used to move Windows DLLs to the right places, but when meson discovers that we are on macOS, the DLLs are moved using install_name_tool, which only works will macOS *.dylibs and resulting in failures. We have to fix it by replacing the last line with a pass:

#vi /usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/mesonbuild/scripts/depfixer.py
- pip:
    name: meson

#./build_proton.sh
- shell: |
    cd Proton
    bash build_proton.sh

#STEAM_COMPAT_DATA_PATH=%HOME/.proton/ ./proton run THE/PATH/TO/EXE
